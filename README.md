# ErieMC2023
This repository includes (1) supporting information (`mc_chla_ms2_SI.pdf`) to Qian et al (2025) and (2) R code and Lake Erie algal bloom toxicity forecasting project data.

There are five Rmd files in the folder `R`. To replicate the result, these files should be run in sequence. Some time-consuming tasks were commented out and we saved the output in the `saved` subfolder. The graphical device `tikz` produces figures in Qian et al (2025) which was typeset using $\LaTeX$.
