# ErieMC2023
This repository includes (1) supporting information (`mc_chla_ms2_SI.pdf`) to the paper submitted to *Journal of Environmental Management* and (2) R code and Lake Erie algal bloom toxicity forecasting project data.

There are five Rmd files. To replicate the result, these files should be run in sequence. Some time-consuming tasks were commented out. The graphical device `tikz` produces figures for the manuscript submitted to *Journal of Environmental Management* in $\LaTeX$.
